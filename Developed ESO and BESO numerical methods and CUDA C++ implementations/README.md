W propose a Bi-directional Evolutionary Structural Optimization (BESO) methods with a targetfunctions based on FFT-GFIEM(Greenâ€™s Function Integral Equation Method based on fast matvec(implemented using Fast Fourier Transforms)) solver. It allows to find an optimal structure in a3D space for homogeneous objects (lenses and metallic reflectors). The derived formula of tar-get function gradient row expedited the iterative optimization processes to predict better solution.Such examples as antennas, glass lenses, parabolic reflectors, splitters are considered. Numericalexperimentsshowthatdiscretegradientalgorithmconvergesmuchfasterthangreedyalgorithmforall considered cases. The developed BESO numerical methods were implemented using CUDA(C++) parallelization. In addition, the efficiency of parallelization in CUDA (C++) was analyzedin comparison with the computation time consumptions on Numpy (Python).
