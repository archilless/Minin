We propose a topology optimization method with a target function based on FFT-JVIE solver. It allows to find an optimal structure in a 3D space for homogeneous objects (lenses and metallic reflectors).
Such examples as glass lenses, parabolic reflectors are considered.
Numerical experiments show that discrete gradient algorithm converges much faster than 
greedy algorithm for all considered cases. 

Mainly, this is development of project for classes of Numerical Linear Algebra and Optimization at Skoltech, 2017-2018.
